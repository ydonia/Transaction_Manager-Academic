# Transaction_Manager-Academic
I created a program to record bank account transactions
The user gets presented a menu, where they can create either a regular account or a premium account.
They can then deposit and withdraw from the accounts all they like: The program will keep track of this.
Once the user chooses to print the info for the accounts, all the accounts are displayed as well as the transaction history for each account.
